# Book-Up 

## Motivation 
We all know the problematic back and forth when trying to make appointments.
To solve this problem, we created Book-Up as a tool for scheduling meetings, appointments and events. 
With Book-Up all you have to do is:
1. create an offer with a desired duration
2. set your available time
3. copy & paste / send the generated link to the place/person you want

The person that opens the link will see the offer with your available time in a fancy calendar. He/She/It just has to select a timeslot for the appointment and submit the choice. 


## Installation 

In order to make the whole application work you have to clone [the backend](https://code.fbi.h-da.de/bookup/bookup-backend.git) and this project into the same directory:
```bash
+--ExampleDirectory
   |
   +---bookup-backend
   |
   +---bookup-frontend
```
Then, you have to install the `node_modules` by executing `npm i` in the `bookup-backend` directory.
Do the same for the `bookup-frontend` directory.

Finally, open a terminal for `ExampleDirectory` and execute 
```bash 
docker-compose up
```
